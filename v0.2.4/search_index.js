Reports are a mixture of text and data objects, and are lazy in the sense that they are easy to create and their contents are only rendered when the report is displayed or written to a file. This way, reports can be generated as part of algorithms and workflows with only a small runtime overhead.\n\nThe central function of the package is lazyreport. It generates a report object that can be rendered (via show and display) in different MIME types. lazyreport allows for appending content to reports.\n\nReports are displayed automatically in the REPL (as far as supported by the report objects), in Jupyter and Pluto notebooks, and in Visual Studio Code (when using the Julia extension). Reports can also be written to files using write_lazyreport.\n\nAny objects that can render to the current Julia display (resp. the chosen output MIME-type) should work fine, including Plots.jl and Makie.jl plots, and so on. In addition, LazyReports also has special out-of-the-box support for StatsBase.Histogram (one-dimensional only).\n\nFor example:\n\nusing LazyReports, StructArrays, StatsBase, Markdown, Typstry, Plots\n\ntbl = StructArray(\n    col1 = rand(5),\n    col2 = [rand(3) for i in 1:5],\n    col3 = [:(a[1]), :(a[2]), :(a[3]), :(a[4]), :(a[5])],\n    col4 = [fit(Histogram, rand()^3 * 1000 * randn(10^4), nbins = 50) for i in 1:5],\n)\n\nrpt = lazyreport(\n    \"# New report\",\n    \"Table 1:\", tbl,\n    \"Markdown math:\",\n    md\"$\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$\",\n    \"Typst math (via [Typstry](https://github.com/jakobjpeters/Typstry.jl)):\",\n    typst\"$sum_(i=1)^n x_i$\"\n)\nlazyreport!(rpt, \"Figure 1:\", stephist(randn(10^3)))\nlazyreport!(rpt, \"Figure 2:\", histogram2d(randn(10^4), randn(10^4), format = :png))\n\nThe lower-level function LazyReports.pushcontent! can be specialized to control how objects of specific types are added to reports (e.g. by converting them to Markdown, tables or supported content types first).","category":"section"},{"location":"#Lazy-tables","page":"Home","title":"Lazy tables","text":"lazytable wraps/converts Tables.jl-compatible objects and allows for adding custom column labels.\n\nusing IntervalSets\n\ntbldata = (\n    a = ClosedInterval.(rand(5), rand(5).+1),\n    b = rand(Bool, 5),\n    c = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"],\n)\n\nlazyreport(\n    \"# Table report\",\n    lazytable(tbldata, headers = Dict(:a => \"Intervals\", :b => \"Booleans\", :c => \"Strings\"))\n)","category":"section"},{"location":"#Rendering-Plots","page":"Home","title":"Rendering Plots","text":"When rendering reports using MIME(\"text/plain\"), e.g. when showing reports on the REPL and when writing reports to \".txt\" files, LazyReports will try to convert Plots.jl plots to the Plots.UnicodePlotsBackend.
